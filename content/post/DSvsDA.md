# What on earth is Data Science..


My take on the data scientist..


This post is categorized as opinion! It’s the best interpretation I could formulate. As such, it should be taken as an over-fitted understanding based on my experiences. More
I am an INTP and for the sake of this post I like to (read: have) to have a clear understanding of something before I can do it, visualize it, explain it, strive for it yada-yada etc. And once I have accomplished this clear understanding I can move forward. Progress!!

Few things have tripped me up in understanding them as much as “data science.” As everyone has, I saw the [HBR article](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century) in college as a finance, information system dual major and was intrigued. I got the impression lead analytics figures, proud of their intellect and their skills with some programming smashed with statistics, re-branded themselves as “data scientists.” Since then I’ve worked as an analyst at various organizations and industries all the while trying to figure out how I can, in my head, segment data-sciencey folk from analysts; a mental clustering to help my understanding, if you will.


Over four years went by, my algorithm still churning away with diversion instead of conversion (I can’t help but work in the puns…it’s a curse, really). For me, the confusion stemmed from some of the descriptions of data scientists I’ve come across, especially early on. On this [article](http://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-money-you-earn-in-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century-2016-2) they mention from IBM’s website “The data scientist role has been described as 'part analyst, part artist.' Anjul Bhambhri, vice president of big data products at IBM, says, 'A data scientist is somebody who is inquisitive, who can stare at data and spot trends.” That’s so ambiguous to me. These descriptions varied vastly, of course, but I got the same thing out of them:



1.	Data scientists have some innate gift which allows them to be what they are with minimal in the way of training and time necessary to master those ‘gifts.’
2.	They don’t mention arguably the most important aspect: the scientific method.
3.	And how is the “spotting trends” piece different from a capable analyst?



Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I have taken [Andrew Ng](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg)’s courser [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) on machine learning, numerous [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com) courses on R & Python, and [Udacity’s Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree-foundation--nd101) since then and still struggled to communicate to others what data scientists are and why I wanted to become one. I had been attaining the beginner and intermediate skills one is expected to have and yet I couldn’t understand how a data analyst differed from a data scientist.


I finally have my own interpretation of the two roles and how they may differ from my eyes. I understand that with this is a relatively new role and will continue to develop as the amount and sources of new data increase. That being said this is where I think the two positions differ


### Analyst
Their Product: Aggregates, summarizes, and develops tools and visual dashboards that distils some domain to an at-a-glance view that highlight trends and the goings on. The analyst produces some tantalizing views that require domain expertise and communication and some modeling may be present. Their audience is generally a business user(s) who intakes those many features (Trends, aggregates, any one-off data points etc.) and uses their experience to render some response. Outliers will most likely be included in the over-all dashboard as they still may represent a legitimate data point as opposed to a measurement error, however far outside norms, but will simply be called out to the ultimate consumer of the information


The learning & experience is accumulated on behalf of the business user over their years of experience. That with the fast-moving nature of today’s business data requires a specialized role, data analyst, to bring it all together to provide the one-stop-shop view the decision maker needs to make a good decision
Scientist:


### Scientist

The Scientist on the other hand would approach the data from a different perspective. Her/his goal is to statistically determine extract  She/he will tend to focus more on the data as observations of some event. Summary statistics will be computed to get a better understanding of the
